****House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning****


****Project Overview****

  This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is developed using Python   and scikit-learn, and the results are presented in a dynamically generated PowerPoint presentation.

****Technologies Used****
  Python3.x
  Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
   
    **Libraries**:
        pandas
        numpy
        scikit-learn
        python-pptx

****Dataset****
  
  The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on house prices and their features.

****Installation****

  Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn python-pptx

****How to Run the Project****

  Clone the repository or download the script.

  Ensure all dependencies are installed.

****Output****

  The model predicts house prices based on input features.

  Example of op:
  Mean Squared Error: 5234567.89
  Presentation Created Successfully!
 
  ****Future Enhancements****

Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

Add visualizations of predicted vs actual prices.

Deploy the model as a web application.
